# This file illustrates how to set up a correct G'MIC filter source
# (e.g. to be included in 'gmic-community/include/' afterwards).
#
# It contains toy filters in various categories to show how things are
# working. This should be a good basis for creating your own filters
# for the G'MIC plug-in.
#
#---------------------------------------------------------------------
# ^ Remove this header when creating your G'MIC filter source ! ^
# ^ But keep the first line '#@gmic' (mandatory), it identifies the file
# as a G'MIC filter source ^

#------ Syntax rules for a G'MIC command file :
#
#*** General syntax :
#
# - Each line starting with 'command_name :' starts a new definition of the G'MIC custom command 'command_name'.
# - Each line starting with '#' is a comment line.
# - Any other line is considered as the continuation of a previously started G'MIC custom command.
#
#*** Specific rules for the command-line interface 'gmic':
#
# - A comment line starting with '#@cli' will be parsed by 'gmic' to display help for
#    G'MIC custom commands (when invoked with option 'h'). More precisely :
#
#      _ '#@cli :: subsection' defines a new command subsection in the displayed help.
#      _ '#@cli command_name : arguments_format1 : arguments_format2 : ... : (qualifier)'
#        starts a new command description.
#      _ '#@cli : description' add a new description line to the current command description.
#
#*** Specific rules for the universal plug-in :
#
# - A comment line starting with '#@gui' will be parsed by the plug-in to define the filters tree.
# - A comment line starting with '#@gui_xx' will define a filter only for a specific language 'xx'
#    (e.g. 'en','fr'...).
# - A comment line starting with '#@gui_xx hide(/Filter or folder name)' will hide the existing
#    filter of folder for the locale 'xx'.
# - More precisely, the syntax of a '#@gui' comment line is :
#
#    '#@gui Folder name'
#
# or
#
#    '#@gui Command name : command, preview_command (zoom_factor)[+] [: default_input_mode]
#    '#@gui : parameter1 = typedef(arguments1...), parameter2 = typedef(arguments2...)'
#    '#@gui : parameter3 = typedef(arguments3...),
#
#   where :
#
#      'command' is the G'MIC command name called to process the image.
#
#      'preview_command' is the G'MIC command name called to process the preview.
#
#           Note that you can optionally specify a float-valued factor>=0 between parentheses at the end of
#           the 'preview_command' to force the default zoom factor used by the preview for this filter.
#           Use (0) for a 1:1 preview, (1) for previewing the whole image, (2) for 1/2 image and so on...
#           You can also put an additional '+' sign after the parenthesis to specify the rendered preview
#           is still accurate for different zoom factors.
#
#      'default_input_mode' set the default input mode for that filter. It can be
#        { x=none | .=active (default) | *=all | +=active & below | -=active & above | v=all visible | i=all invisible }
#
#      'parameter = typedef' tells about the names, types and default values of the filter parameters.
#
#           'typedef' can be :
#
#      _ 'bool(default_value={ 0 | 1 | false | true })':
#          Add a boolean parameter (0 or 1) (as a checkbutton).
#
#      _ 'button(_alignment)':
#          Add a boolean parameter (0 or 1) (as a button).
#
#      _ 'choice(_default_index,Choice0,..,ChoiceN)':
#          Add a integer parameter (as a combobox).
#
#      _ 'color(R,_G,_B,_A)':
#          Add R,G,B[,A] parameters (as a colorchooser).
#
#      _ 'point(_X,_Y,_removable={ -1 | 0 | 1 },_burst={ 0 | 1 },_R,_G,_B,_[-]A,_radius[%])':
#          Add X,Y parameters (as a moveable point over the preview).
#
#      _ 'value(value)':
#          Add a pre-defined value parameter (not displayed).
#
#      _ 'file[_in,_out](_default_filename)':
#          Add a filename parameter (as a filechooser).
#
#      _ 'float(default_value,min_value,max_value)':
#          Add a float-valued parameter (as a float slider).
#
#      _ 'folder(_default_foldername)':
#          Add a foldername parameter (as a folderchooser).
#
#      _ 'int(default_value,min_value,max_value)':
#          Add a integer parameter (as an integer slider).
#
#      _ 'link(_alignment,_label,URL)':
#          Display a URL (do not add a parameter).
#
#      _ 'note(_label)':
#          Display a label (do not add a parameter).
#
#      _ 'text(_is_multiline={ 0 | 1 },_default text)':
#          Add a single or multi-line text parameter (as a text entry).
#
#      _ 'separator()':
#          Display an horizontal separator (do not add a parameter).
#
#   Type separators '()' can be replaced by '[]' or '{}' if necessary (for instance if parentheses are required in
#   an argument of the typedef, e.g in a text). You can also replace 'typedef' by '_typedef' to tell the plug-in not
#   to update the image preview when the corresponding parameter is modified.
#   After the closing separator, you may specify a 'visibility state' character for the parameter, which can be
#   { _0=Hidden | _1=Grayed-out | _2=Visible (default) }, opt. followed by a propagation character that tells
#   if this visibility state must be propagated to neighboring non-valued interface widgets
#   (s.a. separator(), link() or note()).
#   This propagation character can be:
#   { '+'=propagate forward | '-'=propagate backward | '*'=propagate in both directions }.
#
#   Use '_none_' as a special command or preview_command to tell the plug-in that the entry requires no G'MIC call.
#
#   A G'MIC command can set new values for each filter parameter, through the status (see command 'status').
#   To do so, the returned status must follow the syntax :
#   '{params1}{params2}{..}{paramsN}' where N must be exactly equal to the number of parameters
#   for the current filter. Optionnally, you can append to each {param} its visibility state suffix ( e.g: {param}_1 ).
#
#   A G'MIC command can also specify the output blending mode, the opacity and the position of each of the output image
#   (i.e. layer in the plug-in). To do so, set the image name to something like:
#   'mode(grainmerge),opacity(50),pos(30,50),name(name)'.
#
#     - Blending mode name should be the same as the argument of the 'blend' command.
#     - Opacity is a float number in [0,100].
#     - X and Y positions are integers.
#     - 'name' is the layer name.
#
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The filters below will go the the 'Testing / John Doe' category. This is a good 'standard' location
# for placing new filters that are still in testing mode.
# Once considered as stable, such filters can be moved to one of the existing (considered as 'stable') category
# (e.g. 'Artistics' or 'Details', or moved in a brand new category if no one corresponds to the topic of the filters.

# A last important note : to be able to test your external filter source, copy it as
# '$HOME/.gmic' (for Unix-like OS) or '%APPDATA/gmic' (for Windows-like OS). It
# will be considered as 'local' filter source by the plug-in. Once everything is working
# fine, you may want to submit your G'MIC filter source to the 'gmic-community' repository
# (with a pull-request):

# https://github.com/dtschump/gmic-community/
